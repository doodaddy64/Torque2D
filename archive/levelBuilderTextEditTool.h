/// This class implements a TGB level builder tool for editing t2dTextObjects.
/// Currently the tool supports moving the cursor position via clicking and
/// arrow keys, highlighting text via click and drag, and inserting and
/// deleting text. The tool has it's own undo manager for handling incremental
/// changes to the object's text and an undo action that handles the text edit
/// across the whole editing session.
/// 
/// Future Additions:
/// Support for common text editing shortcuts. Like, shift + left highlights
/// the next character to the left.

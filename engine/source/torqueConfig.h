//Hi, and welcome to the Torque Config file.
//
//This file is a central reference for the various configuration flags that
//you'll be using when controlling what sort of a Torque build you have. In
//general, the information here is global for your entire codebase, applying
//not only to your game proper, but also to all of your tools.
//
//This file also contains information which is used for various other needs,
//for instance, defines indicating what engine we're building, or what version
//we're at.

/// What engine are we running? The presence and value of this define are
/// used to determine what engine (TGE, T2D, etc.) and version thereof we're
/// running - useful if you're a content pack or other 3rd party code
/// snippet!

/// Define me if you want to enable debug guards on the FrameAllocator.
/// 
/// This is similar to the above memory manager guards, but applies only to the
/// fast FrameAllocator temporary pool memory allocations. The guards are only
/// checked when the FrameAllocator frees memory (when it's water mark changes).
/// This is most useful for detecting buffer overruns when using FrameTemp<> .
/// A buffer overrun in the FrameAllocator is unlikely to cause a crash, but may
/// still result in unexpected behavior, if other FrameTemp's are stomped.

/// on other platforms as well. Use this #define anywhere alignment is needed.

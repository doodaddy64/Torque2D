/// Represents a queued event in the sim.
///
/// Sim provides an event queue for your convenience, which
/// can be used to schedule events. A few things which use
/// this event queue:
///
///     - The scene lighting system. In order to keep the game
///       responsive while scene lighting occurs, the lighting
///       process is divided into little chunks. In implementation
///       terms, there is a subclass of SimEvent called
///       SceneLightingProcessEvent. The process method of this
///       subclass calls into the lighting code, telling it to
///       perform the next chunk of lighting calculations.
///     - The schedule() console function uses a subclass of
///       SimEvent called SimConsoleEvent to keep track of
///       scheduled events.

                            ///  of addition to the list.

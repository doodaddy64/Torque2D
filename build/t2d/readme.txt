Stuff needed for this to work on Mac and Linux
   ProjectGenerator templates for trial and regular projects.
   Doxygen binary and path set in common.sh.
   Bitrock binary and path set in common.sh.
   PHP binary and path set in common.sh.
   TGBGame binaries In tgb/gameData/T2DProject directory.
   Scripts to compile the engine in buildTrial.sh and buildEngine.sh.

The build process starts with packageT2D.sh. It pretty much just calls into a
bunch of specialized scripts. Each of these sub-scripts is designed to be able
to run by itself with as few dependencies as possible.

It is necessary to have the files laid out in a specific directory structure
beyond just what is in the repository. That is:

Root
   |-build
   |-engine
   |-games
   |-tgb
   |-tools
   |-documentation (Currently the entire documentation tree from DocsAndDemos.
                    In the future it will be just the required doc files)
   |-demos (From the DocsAndDemos repo for this specific version)
   |-trial (Complete checkout of the branches/trial repo)

If any of these directories move, it should just be a matter of updating the
reference to it in common.sh.

This is the basic flow of the scripts:

Build T2D (version, outputDirectory, demoList)
   Build Trial
      Run projectGenerator with t2d trial config.
      If Windows run VC8 with Torque solution and TorqueGameBuilder project.

      If Linux run make with Torque solution and TorqueGameBuilder project.
      Run projectGenerator with t2d config.
   Build Engine
